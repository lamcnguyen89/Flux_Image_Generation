# Image Generator

Local image and video generation with a Flask model catalog and generation forms.
Model assets and experiment notebooks live in `Models/Model_Families/`.
See the [model folder layout](Models/Model_Families/README.md) for the checkpoint
and LoRA folders, SDXL/FLUX/WAN configurations, and reusable JSON examples.

The application is in `src/image_generator/`. SDXL and FLUX text-to-image and
WAN 2.2 image-to-video generation have reusable backends and command-line runners.
The notebooks remain independent experiments.

Catalog discovery, manifest validation, and settings resolution are implemented
without GPU dependencies. Run `python scripts/inspect_catalog.py` to list models
and LoRAs, or add `--json` to inspect their effective settings. See the
[catalog guide](Documents/Catalog.md) for the Python API, override rules, and tests.

Run `.venv/bin/python main.py` and open <http://127.0.0.1:5000> to browse the
catalog and inspect each model's resolved settings and linked LoRAs. See the
[web interface guide](Documents/Web_Interface.md) for configuration and tests.

Choose **Configure generation** to edit SDXL, FLUX, WAN, or MiniMax settings and preview
the typed request. For a demo without weights or a GPU, run
`IMAGE_GENERATOR_CATALOG_ROOT=tests/fixtures/model_families .venv/bin/python main.py`.
See [generation UI testing](Documents/Generation_UI.md) for the workflow contract,
fixture pages, and automated/manual checks. SDXL, FLUX, WAN, and MiniMax support queue submission
and live progress. WAN and MiniMax save uploaded sources and display playable MP4 results,
conditioning images, and actual output details. The forms also save/reset model settings and shared adapter
defaults, retain disabled LoRAs, and support checkpoint-specific strengths.

Catalog loading automatically creates missing model/LoRA defaults from the
family's example JSON and missing user files with empty overrides. Existing
files are preserved. New entries receive unique IDs and detected weight paths;
review template settings and supply actual compatibility metadata before generation.
The reusable `initialize_asset()` helper also supports future upload handlers;
see [manifest initialization](Documents/Catalog.md#automatic-manifest-initialization).

Generate one image with the catalog's base SDXL model:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/generate_sdxl.py \
  --prompt "A mountain lake at sunrise" --seed 42 --no-loras
```

Images and matching JSON metadata are saved under `Images/`. Add `--dry-run` to
validate and print the request without loading models. See the
[SDXL backend guide](Documents/SDXL_Workflow.md) for checkpoints, schedulers,
multiple LoRAs, cache configuration, and the Python API.

Generate a FLUX image or animate a local image with WAN:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/generate_flux.py \
  --prompt "A mountain lake at sunrise" --seed 42 --no-loras
.venv/bin/python scripts/generate_wan.py \
  --input-image Images/input.png --prompt "A gentle breeze moves across the lake" \
  --frames 49 --seed 42 --no-loras
```

WAN outputs MP4, conditioning PNG, and JSON files under `Videos/`, processing
variations one at a time. Both runners support `--dry-run`. See the
[FLUX guide](Documents/FLUX_Workflow.md) and [WAN guide](Documents/WAN_Workflow.md)
for family-specific settings, adapters, and Python APIs.

Run `bash scripts/setup.sh` to install SDXL, FLUX, WAN, and MiniMax H3 into the
shared `.venv`, including the native ComfyUI checkout and dependencies for MiniMax.
Append `--dev` for development and notebook tools. See
[environment setup](Documents/Setup.md) for prerequisites, GPU wheels, and checks.

MiniMax H3 uses the same catalog, UI contract, LoRA selection, and generation
request API through its native ComfyUI adapter. Start with a validated request:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/generate_minimax.py \
  --input-image Images/input.png --prompt "A gentle camera movement" --seed 42 --dry-run
```

See [MiniMax setup, generation, and tests](Documents/MiniMax_Workflow.md) for its
ComfyUI runtime, component requirements, fixture form, and silent MP4 outputs.

The shared durable queue and worker lifecycle are implemented. Start a dedicated
worker with `.venv/bin/python -m image_generator.worker`, or test two queued fake
workflows producing small PNGs with `.venv/bin/python tests/demo_queue.py`.
See [queue usage, recovery, and tests](Documents/Worker_Queue.md). SDXL, FLUX, WAN, and MiniMax web forms
submit jobs, show loading and denoising progress, and display saved images or videos.
See [FLUX UI operation and validation](Documents/FLUX_UI_Execution.md) for image
generation, guidance controls, and GPU validation.
See [WAN UI operation and validation](Documents/WAN_UI_Execution.md) for uploads,
video results, and a GPU smoke test.
See [MiniMax UI operation and validation](Documents/MiniMax_UI_Execution.md) for
H3 controls, native ComfyUI progress, runtime options, and GPU checks.
Start both in one terminal with `bash scripts/start.sh` (automatically uses
`.venv`); Ctrl+C stops the web app and lets an active generation finish. See
[SDXL execution and GPU testing](Documents/SDXL_UI_Execution.md).
To run the same launcher automatically at boot, install the single
[systemd service](systemd/README.md).
